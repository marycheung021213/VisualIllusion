# Rotary Illusion Flow
**Creative Coding**

"Rotary Illusion Flow" is a creative programming project built with Processing. In this project, set against a dark background, a captivating visual illusion is crafted using groups of four rectangles. The illusion is primarily derived from the rotation direction of the rectangles and the subtle time differences introduced by the program structure.

Here is the repository for the source code.
